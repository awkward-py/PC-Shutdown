# PC-Shutdown

You can save this script as `shutdown.sh` and make it executable by running `chmod +x shutdown.sh` in your terminal. Then you can run it by typing `./shutdown.sh <minutes>` where `<minutes>` is the number of minutes you want to wait before shutting down your PC. For example, if you want to shut down your PC after 10 minutes, you can run `./shutdown.sh 10`.
